# R3JWT

**R3JWT** (Ruby on Rails React JWT) is a Template for a Rails application that is built as a backend API only application and utilizes ESBuild to mount a React application on top of it to serve as the front it.

This will be a boilerplate for JWT authentication between the Rails and React applications.

Once this Project is completed, it will be converted to a template that can be used for any rails application that needs to build APIs with authentication between the backend and the front end.
